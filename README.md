# LeanTiler

LeanTiler is a user-story driven approach to providing a set of command line
tools for macOS for building your own MapBox Vector Tile pipeline.

The key learning used by this project comes from [James
Milner's](https://loxodrome.io/) [Tiler](https://github.com/geovation/tiler)
project.

Development is being carried out in the `mvp` branch. This project is being
developed openly and in the public but will not be recommended for public use
until the `mvp` branch is merged here into `master`.
